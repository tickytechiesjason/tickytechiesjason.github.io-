            <p id="pizza">Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish 
                consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based 
                dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients 
                (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), 
                which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired 
                oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes 
                pizza is known as a pizzaiolo
                In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is 
                presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. 
                In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held 
                in the hand.The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a 
                Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on 
                the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and 
                the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries. 
                It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast 
                food item in Europe and North America, available at pizzerias (restaurants 
                specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via 
                pizza delivery. Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be 
                reheated in an ordinary home oven.

            <h2>Hotdog</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/06/21/17/57/chicken-skewers-2428025_960_720.jpg" alt="A hotdog">

                A hot dog (less commonly spelled hotdog) is a food consisting of a grilled
                or steamed sausage served in the slit of a partially sliced bun, and much 
                debate has centered around whether or not it can be considered a sandwich; 
                the term can also refer to the sausage itself. The sausage used is a wiener 
                (Vienna sausage) or a frankfurter (Frankfurter Würstchen, also just called 
                frank). The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled dish.
                Hot dog preparation and condiments vary worldwide. Typical condiments include 
                mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, relish, and cheese sauce, and common garnishes 
                include onions, sauerkraut, jalapeños, chili, grated cheese, coleslaw, bacon, 
                and olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs 
                in a blanket. The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog 
                Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.
                These types of sausages were culturally imported from Germany and became popular 
                in the United States. It became a working-class street food in the U.S., sold at 
                stands and carts. The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American 
                culture. Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the 
                hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century. 
                Its preparation varies regionally in the country, emerging as an important part 
                of other regional cuisines, including Chicago street cuisine.

            <h2>Spring Rolls</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2019/06/06/04/47/egg-roll-4255184_960_720.jpg" alt=spring-rolls>
            <p id="spring Rolls">
                Spring rolls are a large variety of filled, rolled appetizers or dim sum found in East Asian, 
                South Asian, Southeast Asian and Latin American cuisine. The name is a literal translation of 
                the Chinese chūn juǎn. The kind of wrapper, fillings, and cooking technique 
                used, as well as the name, vary considerably within this large area, depending on the region's culture
                Spring rolls were a seasonal food consumed during the spring, and started as a pancake filled with the 
                new season's spring vegetables, a welcome change from the preserved foods of the long winter months. 
                In Chinese cuisine, spring rolls are savory rolls with cabbage and other vegetable fillings inside a 
                thinly wrapped cylindrical pastry. They are usually eaten during the Spring Festival in mainland China, 
                hence the name. Meat varieties, particularly pork, are also popular. Fried spring rolls are generally 
                small and crisp. They can be sweet or savory; the former often with red bean paste filling, and the 
                latter are typically prepared with vegetables. They are fully wrapped before being pan-fried or deep-fried.
                Non-fried spring rolls are typically bigger and more savory. Unlike fried spring rolls, non-fried spring 
                rolls are typically made by filling the wrapping with pre-cooked ingredients. Traditionally, they are a 
                festive food eaten during the Cold Food Day festival and the Tomb Sweeping Day festival in spring to 
                remember and pay respect to ancestors. The Hakka population sometimes also eat spring rolls on the 
                third day of the third month of the lunar calendar. The wrappings can be a flour-based 
                mix or batter.
